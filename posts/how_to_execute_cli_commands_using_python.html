                            When I first started learning to code with Python, there were two major discoveries that immediately broadened my horizons as an amateur programmer. These discoveries were: integrating third-party APIs and using the subprocess module. Both topics hold a similarity, in that they allow you to interact with pre-built systems.
                            <br><br>
                            Let's say for example, you want to be check if a remote server is reachable. To do this you would usually use the 'ping' command line utility. You can try this out for yourself by opening a command prompt and entering <code>ping 8.8.8.8</code>.
                            <br><br>
                            What's happening here? 8.8.8.8 is the IPv4 address for Google's DNS server. By pinging this address, we are checking if our device can reach 8.8.8.8 over the internet. If it is reachable, then you will have an output like this:
                            <br><br>
                            <code>Reply from 8.8.8.8: bytes=32 time=20ms TTL=119</code>
                            <br><br>
                            This is telling us that we received an ICMP packet of 32 bytes; that it took 20ms for a round trip and that the 'time to live' is 119. Great, now we know that the server is reachable and responding to echo requests. But what if we don't want to sit here and manually ping the server every 5 mins? <b>We need to automate it.</b>
