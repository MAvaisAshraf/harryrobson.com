                            I'm Harry Robson, I created this site in an effort to improve my online searchability. Why? Because before I started building this site, you would have to scroll to page 11 of Google to find anything actually about me! You can verify the success of my efforts by checking where I rank today.

                            When someone pings your device, they send you an ICMP echo request. Most computers will automatically reply to all echo requests with a reply that can sometimes reveal more than you may realise...

                            When I first started learning to code with Python, there were two major discoveries that immediately increased my horizons as an amateur programmer. These discoveries were: integrating third-party APIs and using the subprocess module. Both topics hold a similarity, in that they allow you to interact with pre-built systems.
                            <br><br>
                            This post is aimed at beginners and will show you how to use the Python subprocess module to execute system commands from within your programs.

                            Having your own personal website is a great way to take control of your digital identity. I decided that I needed to create my own personal website after finding that a search for my own name yields no results that can even be associated with me, without scrolling to page 11 of Google!

                            This post covers my work-in-progress findings drawn from primary and secondary research regarding personal websites and all aspects of SEO.
